# CIS580_GameProject4
Game Project 4 for CIS 580 - Spring 2020

Controls:
Move -> Arrow Keys
Use Power Up -> Space Bar

Power up must be recharged for 10 seconds after use. It can be used to destroy spikes, or break some walls that are already cracked.

Additional Notes:
I went ahead and left the following debugging key presses active in case you would like to use them:
 - Q -> Go to Previous Level
 - P -> Go to Next Level
 - S -> Go to Starting Position of Current Level
 - E -> Go to Ending Position of Current Level
